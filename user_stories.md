# User Stories

- As the marketing team I want to track the number of votes a product is selected and the percentage it gets selected so we can use that information to know which products to advertise more heavily
- As a user I want fun and interesting products to select so I stay engaged in the site
- As a developer I want to be able to store the amount of times a user selects each product so I can send it to the marketing team to use
